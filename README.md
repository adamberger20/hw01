#*HW01 - Adam Berger *

##Biography

My name is Adam Berger and I am a fourth-year student in the College majoring in *Public Policy* and minoring in *Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations*. I am originally  from Bainbridge, Ohio, a small town about 45-minutes outside of Cleveland. On campus, I work as a tour guide in the Office of College Admissions and proudly serve as the RA of Alper House in Max Palevsky East.

##Why Am I Here?

I wanted to take Computing for the Social Sciences to begin developing a quantitative and computational skillset, with an eye to future research. I don't work as a research assistant, and my BA thesis will employ primarily qualitative methods, but after a couple years off I am planning to pursue a PhD in sociology and I'm looking to expand my toolkit in the spirit of ye olde mixed methods approach to social science research.

##Process and Problems

Once I figured out that I could rely pretty much exclusively on the "Mastering Markdown" guide found [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), it was pretty smooth sailing. At first, I was confused about the difference between Markdown and R Markdown, but a quick google search cleared up the confusion for me. However, I did have some minor issues with the following processes:

1. Headers: It took me a while to figure out that adding more "#"s was what I needed to do to create sub-headers. I was just missing it in the Markdown guide I guess.
2. Photos: I didn't understand why the preview couldn't process my image. I eventually realized I needed to pull from the repo first to make it work.
3. Actually pushing to GitHub: More on this in my pull request note.

I think that's all I have to do. Cheers!
